Improving Sentiment Analysis Accuracy with Python and Machine Learning

This repository contains code and resources for the project "Improving Sentiment Analysis Accuracy with Python and Machine Learning". The goal of this project is to build a sentiment analysis model and apply various techniques to improve its accuracy.
Project Overview

Sentiment analysis is a common Natural Language Processing (NLP) task that involves determining the sentiment or emotion behind a piece of text. In this project, we use the movie_reviews dataset from NLTK, train a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier, and apply several techniques to improve the model's performance.

Techniques Used

- Feature Engineering
- Word Embeddings
- Hyperparameter Tuning
- Ensemble Methods
- Data Augmentation

Requirements

- Python 3.6 or above
- NLTK
- Scikit-learn

Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required libraries.
3. Run the Python script to train and evaluate the sentiment analysis model.

Results

The performance of the model is evaluated using precision, recall, and F1-score. The results show significant improvement in the accuracy of the sentiment analysis model after applying the techniques.
Future Work

This project serves as a starting point for improving sentiment analysis accuracy. Future work could explore other techniques, use different machine learning models, or apply the model to other sentiment analysis tasks.
